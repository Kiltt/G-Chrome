# G-Chrome

#### We're working on getting this extension on the Chrome Extension Web Store, but for now, you can install the extension manually

Manual installation steps: 
* Navigate to https://github.com/sirjonasxx/G-Chrome/releases/tag/latest, download *g_chrome_release.rar* and extract its contents
* Open chrome and enter "chrome://extensions/" in your url bar
* Enable "Developer mode" with the button on the top right of your screen
* Click "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder


After installation, you do not need to do anything with this extension anymore. It requires no interaction, just leave it there!
